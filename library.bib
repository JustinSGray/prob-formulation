  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to provide suggestions and stimulus
	for future research in the field of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization.
	The paper is based in part on observations from the 2006 European-U.S.
	Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) Colloquium that was hosted
	by the German Aerospace Center in Goettingen, Germany, 17- 19 May
	2006. Seventy participants from industry, academia and government
	attended the workshop which featured a rich set of presentations,
	short contributions and discussions. Rather than dwelling extensively
	on past accomplishments and current capabilities of MDO we focus
	on the needs and identified shortcomings which lead to potential
	future research directions. Nevertheless, a brief review of the history
	and current trends in MDO are provided to set the discussion in its
	proper context.},

	local optimization and the industry accepted multidisciplinary optimization
	technique, All-at-Once. Thenew multidisciplinary optimization techniques,

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; The design of multidisciplinary systems (such
	as aircraft, automobiles, and others) often requires an iterative
	cycle that includes a design initialization, a system analysis, a
	sensitivity analysis, and design optimization. This design cycle
	is standard in the field of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization
	(MDO) and has often been referred to in the literature as the Multiple-Discipline-Feasible?
	(MDF) approach. The name stems from the fact that complete is maintained
	in each and every design cycle. The drawback of MDF is that it can
	be a timely and a costly procedure. Numerous researchers have developed
	alternate means for posing and subsequently solving the multidisciplinary
	design problem. One such solution procedure has been referred to
	both as Simultaneous Analysis and Design? (SAND) and All-at-once?
	(AAO), and treats the entire multidisciplinary design cycle as one
	large optimization problem. Another alternate solution procedure
	has been referred to as Individual-Discipline-Feasible? (IDF); this
	procedure exhibits characteristics which lie in between the two extremes
	exemplified by MDF and AAO. IDF assured that each individual discipline
	is feasible on every design cycle, while driving the entire system
	(all disciplines) towards multidisciplinary feasibility. The present
	work will present a rigorous numerical comparison of these solution
	strategies over a wide variety of problem sizes and complexities.
	The purpose of this comparison is for the eventual development of
	heuristics which will govern the appropriateness of a given solution
	strategy for a given set of system characteristics. The multidisciplinary
	design test problems that are used for these comparisons are generated
	by a robust simulation tool called CASCADE.},

  abstract = {In concurrent engineering, an attempt is made to perform design and
	other related activities simultaneously rather than in series as
	in the case of traditional design. This may result in a reduction
	of the duration of the design project, cost savings, and better quality
	of the final design. However, the concurrent engineering approach
	might increase the complexity of the design process and make it more
	difficult to manage. One way to reduce the complexity of a large
	scale design project is to apply decomposition. This paper presents
	a methodology for decomposition of a design process to enhance concurrency.
	The incidence matrix is used to represent the relationship between
	tasks and design parameters. The decomposition of a task-parameter
	incidence matrix is discussed. The constraint-variable decomposition,
	which is a special case of the task-parameter decomposition, is also
	presented for the management of constraints. Clustering of tasks
	involved in the design process allows one to determine a potential
	group of tasks that might be performed simultaneously or tasks that
	need a special attention during the design process. As a result of
	decomposition, the design cycle might be reduced. Another advantage
	of grouping tasks is the simplification of scheduling and management
	of the design project. Finally, the proposed approach provides a
	systematic way of decomposing a design problem into subproblems.},

  abstract = {$\Pi$MDOis a software framework which allows the automatic implementation
	ofmultidisci- plinary design optimization (MDO) architectures to
	find the optimum of any appropriately defined multidisciplinary problem.
	A significant improvement and extension of the $\pi$MDO framework
	is presented. Using the inherent advantages of $\pi$MDOs object oriented
	and highly flexible structure, several semi-analytic sensitivity
	methods are implemented for the MDO architectures within the framework.
	Their generalized nature allows the application of these powerful
	and efficient methods to any problem defined within $\pi$MDO, without
	modification to the existing structure of the problem. Further, exploiting
	information gathered by these methods, a new meta MDO architecture
	is proposed which dynami- cally reconfigures the problem to speed
	the optimization while maintaining the fidelity of the original analysis.
	This hybrid approach uses the existing architectures in $\pi$MDO
	en- capsulated within each other to reduce the dimensionality of
	coupling between disciplines. Again, due to the object oriented nature
	of $\pi$MDO, no modifications are required to the problem statement
	or the MDO architectures within the framework. Initial results sug-
	gest that both these additions produce valuable performance gains
	while maintaining the general flexibility and simplicity characteristic
	of $\pi$MDO.},

	methods together with iterative improvement techniques are proposed
	for hypergraph partitioning. A known spectral K-partitioning formulation,
	which accounts for partition sizes and edge weights, is extended
	to graphs with also vertex weights. The OMBD formulation is robust
	enough to account for computational demands and resources and strength
	of interdependencies between the computational modules contained
	in the model.},

	flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the
	shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a modularization
	is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules.
	A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and
	unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the
	unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals
	outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are
	discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with
	the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more
	subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative
	approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic
	approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased
	attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade,
	and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment
	of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning.
	The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers
	and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book
	deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and
	classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety
	of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties
	discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and
	a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques
	from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector
	machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance
	vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning
	curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation
	methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book
	contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets
	are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background
	and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

	must be defined. Because of the interdependency of variables, specifications
	for some must be known or assumed before others can be specified.
	A technique called the Design Structure System can assist in defining
	specifications for variables when simultaneous solutions are required.
	The first step is to list each variable along with the variables
	that must be specified prior to the listed variable. Second, these
	are depicted on a precedence matrix. Third, a process of partitioning
	is initiated. This is accomplished by reordering the variables such
	that they fall under a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right
	corner of the matrix. This will result in a number of grouped variables.
	Fourth, an iteration process is begun by estimating a variable in
	each group of variables in order to specify the rest of the variables.
	Finally, an ordering process is completed with the various groups
	of variables.},
