Fundamental Problem Formulation

General Problem Formulation represented as a Network Graph

Tie into Complex Design? 

Ideas: 
    - Problem Formulation as a minimal directed cyclic graph
    - Derive specific problem formulation for solution methods, increasing number of nodes and edges in graph
    - Cycles show up for necessary convergence
    - Collisions require engineering decisions 

Global vs Local Variables in the Network Graph? I have not thought of this issue before and I'm not sure how it would show up...

#slightly more structured outline for a paper
========================================================================

- Introduction/Motivation
    - Need to fully describe the problem in a way that provides all the necessary information to solve the problem using ANY solution method
    - Should be able to take the problem definition and manipulate it to include solution information
    - Need to be able to build up the definition, or add to it to represent additions to the problem 
    - History of using graphs to represent problem definition 
        - DSM, and others
        - XDSM 
        - Ken Moore's Work on derivatives

- Theory
    - Describe graph syntax, 
        - Variables and Components are nodes
        - Edges represent connectivity
        - Describe Cycles
        - Graph weights? Edges or Nodes? 

    - Simple, but instructive test cases that include
        - Conflicts 
        - Cycles 
        - Paths
        - Questions: 
            - How to represent design variables, Residuals, constraints, objectives in the graph

- Examples: Demonstrate the fundamental formulation and specific derived formulations for solution methods
    - Sellar Problem
    - Scalable Problem
    - ASAT Problem

- Usefulness beyond problem definition: 
    - Implementation of a Graph based problem formulation into an MDAO framework?
    - Algorithmic Manipulation of the problem formulation graph to find effective solution paths? 
    - Addition of new analyses to an existing problem?
