@article{Kusiak1993,
    Abstract = {In concurrent engineering, an attempt is made to perform design and other related activities simultaneously rather than in series as in the case of traditional design. This may result in a reduction of the duration of the design project, cost savings, and better quality of the final design. However, the concurrent engineering approach might increase the complexity of the design process and make it more difficult to manage. One way to reduce the complexity of a large scale design project is to apply decomposition. This paper presents a methodology for decomposition of a design process to enhance concurrency. The incidence matrix is used to represent the relationship between tasks and design parameters. The decomposition of a task-parameter incidence matrix is discussed. The constraint-variable decomposition, which is a special case of the task-parameter decomposition, is also presented for the management of constraints. Clustering of tasks involved in the design process allows one to determine a potential group of tasks that might be performed simultaneously or tasks that need a special attention during the design process. As a result of decomposition, the design cycle might be reduced. Another advantage of grouping tasks is the simplification of scheduling and management of the design project. Finally, the proposed approach provides a systematic way of decomposing a design problem into subproblems.},

@article{Parnas1972,
    Abstract = {This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a modularization is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},

@article{Brown2005,
    Abstract = {Three multilevel multidisciplinary optimization techniques, Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, Collaborative Optimization, and Modified Collaborative Optimization, are applied to the design of a reusable launch vehicle, evaluated, and compared in this study. In addition to comparing the techniques against each other, they are also compared with designs reached via fixed-point iteration of disciplines with local optimization and the industry accepted multidisciplinary optimization technique, All-at-Once. Thenew multidisciplinary optimization techniques, particularly Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, showed greater ability than fixed-point iteration to design for a global objective and were more applicable to complex systems than All-at-Once. This study was the first time that the novel multidisciplinary optimization methods were compared qualitatively and quantitatively under controlled experimentation practices. It is still impossible to statistically determine whether any one of the novel multidisciplinary optimization techniques is better than another, because more studies using different test problems corroborating the conclusions made here are needed.},

    Abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

Seventy participants from industry, academia and government attended the workshop which featured a rich set of presentations, short contributions and discussions. Rather than dwelling extensively on past accomplishments and current capabilities of MDO we focus on the needs and identified shortcomings which lead to potential future research directions. Nevertheless, a brief review of the history and current trends in MDO are provided to set the discussion in its proper context.},

In this study, the authors have used both theoretical as well as empirical validation for validating already proposed set of metrics for the five quality factors.

    Abstract = {$\Pi$MDOis a software framework which allows the automatic implementation ofmultidisci- plinary design optimization (MDO) architectures to find the optimum of any appropriately defined multidisciplinary problem. A significant improvement and extension of the $\pi$MDO framework is presented. Using the inherent advantages of $\pi$MDOs object oriented and highly flexible structure, several semi-analytic sensitivity methods are implemented for the MDO architectures within the framework. Their generalized nature allows the application of these powerful and efficient methods to any problem defined within $\pi$MDO, without modification to the existing structure of the problem. Further, exploiting information gathered by these methods, a new meta MDO architecture is proposed which dynami- cally reconfigures the problem to speed the optimization while maintaining the fidelity of the original analysis. This hybrid approach uses the existing architectures in $\pi$MDO en- capsulated within each other to reduce the dimensionality of coupling between disciplines. Again, due to the object oriented nature of $\pi$MDO, no modifications are required to the problem statement or the MDO architectures within the framework. Initial results sug- gest that both these additions produce valuable performance gains while maintaining the general flexibility and simplicity characteristic of $\pi$MDO.},

Companies consisting of lone individuals will able to leverage social media to conceive of, design, develop, and deploy successful and profitable product lines. A challenge for researchers who are interested in studying, influencing, and supporting this shift in software teaming is to make sure that their research methods protect the privacy and reputation of their stakeholders.},

@article{Hulme2000,
    Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; The design of multidisciplinary systems (such as aircraft, automobiles, and others) often requires an iterative cycle that includes a design initialization, a system analysis, a sensitivity analysis, and design optimization. This design cycle is standard in the field of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) and has often been referred to in the literature as the Multiple-Discipline-Feasible? (MDF) approach. The name stems from the fact that complete is maintained in each and every design cycle. The drawback of MDF is that it can be a timely and a costly procedure. Numerous researchers have developed alternate means for posing and subsequently solving the multidisciplinary design problem. One such solution procedure has been referred to both as Simultaneous Analysis and Design? (SAND) and All-at-once? (AAO), and treats the entire multidisciplinary design cycle as one large optimization problem. Another alternate solution procedure has been referred to as Individual-Discipline-Feasible? (IDF); this procedure exhibits characteristics which lie in between the two extremes exemplified by MDF and AAO. IDF assured that each individual discipline is feasible on every design cycle, while driving the entire system (all disciplines) towards multidisciplinary feasibility. The present work will present a rigorous numerical comparison of these solution strategies over a wide variety of problem sizes and complexities. The purpose of this comparison is for the eventual development of heuristics which will govern the appropriateness of a given solution strategy for a given set of system characteristics. The multidisciplinary design test problems that are used for these comparisons are generated by a robust simulation tool called CASCADE.},

The formulation is a combination of the bi-level Collaborative Optimization framework and the multiobjective approach of the compromise Decision Support Problem. To demonstrate the proposed framework, the design of a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine containing two subsystem analyses is presented. The results indicate that the proposed Collaborative Optimization framework for multidisciplinary robust design optimization effectively attains solutions that are robust to variations in design variables and environmental conditions.},

@article{Steward1981,
    Abstract = {In the process of engineering design, specifications for variables must be defined. Because of the interdependency of variables, specifications for some must be known or assumed before others can be specified. A technique called the Design Structure System can assist in defining specifications for variables when simultaneous solutions are required. The first step is to list each variable along with the variables that must be specified prior to the listed variable. Second, these are depicted on a precedence matrix. Third, a process of partitioning is initiated. This is accomplished by reordering the variables such that they fall under a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the matrix. This will result in a number of grouped variables. Fourth, an iteration process is begun by estimating a variable in each group of variables in order to specify the rest of the variables. Finally, an ordering process is completed with the various groups of variables.},

    Abstract = {Decomposition of large engineering system models is desirable since increased model size reduces reliability and speed of numerical solution algorithms. The article presents a methodology for optimal model-based decomposition (OMBD) of design problems, whether or not initially cast as optimization problems. The overall model is represented by a hypergraph and is optimally partitioned into weakly connected subgraphs that satisfy decomposition constraints. Spectral graph-partitioning methods together with iterative improvement techniques are proposed for hypergraph partitioning. A known spectral K-partitioning formulation, which accounts for partition sizes and edge weights, is extended to graphs with also vertex weights. The OMBD formulation is robust enough to account for computational demands and resources and strength of interdependencies between the computational modules contained in the model.},
